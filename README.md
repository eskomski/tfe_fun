TensorFlow's new Eager Execution API allows for defining and executing operations provided by TensorFlow in an imperative fashion. To experiment with this, I implemented an arbitrarily deep neural network. Having gotten used to the declarative paradigm of traditional TensorFlow programming, this was an interesting exercise! Time permitting, I'm hoping to add more model implementations to this repository.
